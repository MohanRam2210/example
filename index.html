              Cricket World Cup 2023 Points Table. <br> South Africa further solidified themselves as one of the strong
              contenders <br> in 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup tournament after a convincing win <br> over five-time winners
              Australia on Thursday (October 12).

          <p>
             Great bowling display from African pacers, backed by Quinton de Kock's <br> explosive century (109 off 106
             balls), played a pivotal role in South Africa's <br> thumping 134-run victory over Australia in their ICC
             Cricket World Cup <br> match in Lucknow. The loss against South Africa is a big blow to Australia's <br>World
             Cup 2023 plans as now Pat Cummins-led squad have lost back-to-back <br>two matches.
